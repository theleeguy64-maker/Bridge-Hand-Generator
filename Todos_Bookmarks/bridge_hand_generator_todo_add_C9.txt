Bridge Hand Generator – TODO Update

NEW ITEM ADDED (Agreed)

C9. Move exclusions editing into per-seat constraints flow (wizard UX)
Status: TODO
Type: UX / Flow improvement
Risk: Low–Medium (wizard flow only)
Scope: profile_wizard.py only

Problem:
- Exclusions are currently edited as a single group after seat constraints.
- Users naturally expect exclusions to be configured while editing the relevant seat/sub-profile.
- Current flow is confusing because it asks for “Exclusion seat [W]” even though user just edited a specific seat.

Proposed UX:
- During seat editing (e.g., after finishing constraints for seat W), offer:
  “Add / edit exclusions for seat W? (y/N)”
- Then prompt for sub-profile index within that seat and exclusion type (shapes/rule).
- Keep storage model unchanged: profile.subprofile_exclusions remains a global list.

Non-goals:
- No schema change
- No validation change
- No generator/orchestrator change

Acceptance criteria:
- User can add/edit/remove exclusions for the current seat without being asked to re-select the seat.
- Existing exclusions for that seat are discoverable in the same flow.
