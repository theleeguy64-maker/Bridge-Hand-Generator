Bridge Hand Generator – TODO Update

NEW ITEM ADDED (Agreed)

C10. Improve wizard guidance text around exclusion determination (what is being excluded and when)
Status: TODO
Type: UX / Explanatory text
Risk: Low
Scope: profile_wizard.py (text only)

Problem:
- Users are unclear about:
  • When exclusions are applied (during hand matching / generation attempts)
  • What “shape” means (S/H/D/C counts) and that it must sum to 13
  • How exclusions interact with seat + chosen sub-profile selection

Proposed improvements:
- When entering exclusions, display a short explanation:
  “Exclusions are checked after a hand matches the chosen sub-profile; if excluded, the generator rejects the hand and retries.”
- Clarify that shapes are S/H/D/C suit counts (e.g. 4333) and must sum to 13.
- Clarify that exclusions target a specific seat + sub-profile index.

Non-goals:
- No schema change
- No validation logic change
- No generator change

Acceptance criteria:
- A first-time user can correctly predict:
  • what hands will be rejected
  • which seat/sub-profile the exclusion applies to
  • what input format is required
